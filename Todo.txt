TODO:
--new map


BUGS:

--training doesnt work.. almost seems like it minimises peformance..  maybe evolution is fucked
        sometimes there will be a good car and it wont be in the next generation even though elitism should preserve it
        this is only since the last update (10 cars update)

--sometimes cars go missing and i suddenly only have 2-3 ...  cars come back after many generations

--sometimes it just stops as if there is a car moving somewhere that isnt done, but there is none -- in this case counter was == 18 :( how ?
        could be connected to previous bug
--SOLVED: sometimes NNoutput[1] is < 0 ... --> accelerate too, but not the same amount...... how/why ? solved: mutation changed activation function

--make a new much larger map
